#Extract text from a given image Using EasyOCR

1. Write a Python program that uses an OCR library like Pytesseract or EasyOCR, to extract text from a given image.
2. Add code in the program to pre-process the input image before passing it to the OCR library, for better result. Demonstrate the improvement for a given input image with text - with the preprocessing code.
